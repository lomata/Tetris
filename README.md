# Tetris
Final project for CS3 JAVA 

The Tetris game is one of the most popular games ever created.
This project is a Tetris game for single player that requires player to move, drop, and rotate a procession of block that falls into the rectangular Matrix with increasing speeds. Player attempts to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without any empty space( 1 line for 10 points, 2 line for 30 points), but if the block reaches the top the game will be over!
It requires user to  login/ create a new account  before starting the game: if the username does not exist, it will create a new account; but if the username already exists and user forget or mistype the password, it will ask user to re-enter the password until correct.
